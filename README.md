### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Vanilla Javascipt

### About

Like mentioned above this solution is done in pure html,css,js with bootstrap alongside. I used javacript just to get some practice. I wasn't paying attention on anything other than functionallity, and I won't have any further development on this therefore the code could be a lot cleaner. This is my first challenge from frontendmentor so I just rushed to push on github. I have more projects completed and they will be on my portfolio(in development) and on github.
